Also you have a variety of options in terms of trigonometric operations as it offers you to input the values in 5 different units and get the output in your desired one. Along with it the conversion sections have a lot of sub branches with almost all the major usings available for interconversion.Once you select the operation you can perform it endlessly unless you opt back.Note- The back option brings you a step back into a previous menu you can exit the code by the Quit option in the main menu. There are a couple of commands which are system specific so they might not work well. I used them for the most used compilers and the online compilers are surely not one of them.Enjoy!! Suggestions are most welcome.
